<h1><i>Tech4Kidz</i></h1>
<h2>Providing Children With the Best Technology</h2>
<hr/>
<p>
Even though all public schools in New York City are under the Department of Education and should all have the same resources, it is true that <b>schools in lower income neighborhoods don't always have the best resources.</b> Income levels vary throughout the boroughs and neighborhoods. This affects public schools greatly.
<ul>
 <li>Let's say that School A is in Neihgborhood A and that School B is in Neighborhood B.</li>
 <li>Both schools are in need of new computers and both schools inform the city. Neither schools can get computers as early as they need them.</li>
 <li> Neighborhood A is a pretty affluent neighborhood with family incomes starting at <b>$80k</b> (for single parent houeholds; would be doubled the amount if both parents are present) and higher. The families of School A are able to pitch in and raise enough money to buy computers for the school and everyone is happy.</li>
 <li> However for School B, it is not the same case. With family incomes starting at <b>$30k</b> (for single parent houeholds; would be doubled the amount if both parents are present) the people are not able to take control like the people in Neighborhood A did.</li>
