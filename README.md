# Code4Kidz

Code4Kidz is a mock website that would engaged students from K-12th grade and their parents to get the youth interested in coding. We made the mock website in order to showcase what the interns have learned for the summer, how they were able to connect with the students they worked with, and also to promote technology courses into schools that don't have it.
